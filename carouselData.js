        description:`One More Shot is an experimental visual novel game developed by a small team at Dual Path Learning LLC. The game provides an interactive and personalized glimpse at the potential impact of alcohol abuse on a user’s life goals. With a focus on compassionate, non-judgemental delivery of information, the game seeks to give young people the means to assess their own relationship with alcohol.

        We developed this game in Unity using a combination of C#, Javascript and JSON. The most interesting code I worked on in this project was creating a custom parser that could convert the large, branching story we wrote in Twine to dialog cards, complete with stage directions, for the game. 
        
        I worked on this project in a number of roles, including storywriter, technical artist, developer, and finally lead developer. I coordinated different teams in implementing features and assets required by the project. I met routinely with our client to ensure their vision was realized. Currently, I work with our server handler and clients to routinely update the game.`,

        description:`Tarot Journal is a web app that serves as a curated Tarot card reference and streamlined recording tool for tarot readings. Users can design their spread and draw from a virtual deck or record draws from a physical deck, then access the information for each card and record their personal notes. They can then export a convenient print-format page of their results.

        This ongoing, open source* project will continue to evolve as I add new features.
        
        Around October 2022, I discovered an interest in using Tarot reading as a tool for journaling. In tarot readings, you draw cards to place in specific layouts, called spreads, with meanings for the positions. Each card in the 78-card deck also has its own meaning, which can be a overwhelming for a beginner. 
        
        I wanted a tool that allowed me to neatly record my thoughts, and gave me intuitive access to card descriptions. Since I couldn’t find one that met my needs, I decided to develop my own and make it available to others.

        Take a Plant Leave a Plant is a vibrant and growing houseplant enthusiast community housed on Reddit and Discord. Members of the subreddit can buy, trade and sell plants with other members, while the Discord server is a more robust and varied social ground. Due to increased growth, the moderators needed to automate parts of the review system to meet the demand.
        
        I worked remotely with the moderators and another volunteer coder to develop a system to streamline the review process. Users submit their reviews using Google Forms. On a successful review, the Python script will send a confirmation message to the poster, add the review to the community directory, and update the reviewed user's community info. On a failed or flagged review, the bot will alert the appropriate party of the issue, either through Reddit or Discord. Following preliminary bug testing, the bot went live in May 2023.
