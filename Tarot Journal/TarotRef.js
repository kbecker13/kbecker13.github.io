The B on the black pillar stands for Boaz, the pillar of strength. The J on the white pillar stands for Jachin, the pillar of the establishment. The black and white colors of the pillars symbolize duality: masculine and feminine, good and evil, negative and positive. They state that knowledge and acceptance of duality are required to enter this sacred space. The High Priestess\' location between the two pillars suggests that she acts as a mediator between the depths of reality. She symbolizes the third pillar or the path between. Her belief is that both pillars are equal and there is knowledge to be learned in both worlds.<br><br>In her hand, the High Priestess holds a scroll with the word Tora on it, a reference to the Jewish scripture or an anagram for the tarot or maybe both. The scroll is partly covered.

The cross on her robe represents the four directions and the balancing of the four selves: body, heart, mind, and spirit.

Take some time to decide if you are really happy with what you are doing or if you are just going with the \'status quo.\'","Love and Relationships":"When it comes to love and relationships, the Hermit definitely isn\'t a positive \'romance\' card. This doesn\'t mean that it always means the ending of a relationship or singleness, although it can. If you\'re single and wanting love, make sure that you\'re really ready for a relationship.<br><br>Do you struggle with seeking validation from others? Work on that. If you have codependency or security issues, spend time correcting those, this way you can attract a partner or a positive vibration.

In fact, the Hermit\'s central message is to focus on spiritual enlightenment and connecting to one\'s higher self by focusing inward.<br><br>If the Hermit falls in your reading, focus on spiritual work through activities like meditation, connecting to spirit guides, and learning about/working with crystals. <br><br>Because this is a very personal process, it will probably require isolating yourself a bit. This isn\'t necessarily a bad thing.<br><br>Once you raise your spiritual vibration, everything in your life will improve. This includes health, relationships, and finances.","Reversed":"When the Hermit is reversed, the card represents all of the problematic or negative sides of disconnecting from others.

The Five of Pentacles is one that few people desire in a reading. Because it represents sickness, poverty, and general struggle, the only acceptable place for this pentacle is reversed or in the past position.<br><br>Unfortunately, this is not always the case. If the Five of Pentacles has presented itself as a part of your reading, don\'t worry too much.<br><br>The key is learning and growing from the hardships you are having or are about to experience. Knowing what the future could bring makes it easier to tailor our behavior to avoid future heartache.In a figurative sense, the word snow means to overwhelm, cover, or imprison. If you currently feel trapped or beaten down by life\'s problems, then it is not surprising that this card has surfaced. It\'s also possible that things are not as bad as they seem but clouded by negative thoughts.<br><br>The Five of Pentacles in the upright position represents a long journey with many obstacles along the way.<br><br>However, we must keep in mind that although we may not have control of the difficulties we face, the power lies in our reactions.","Visual Description":"The image on the Five of Pentacles is one you\'ll never forget. Although many pentacles represent financial success, card number five of this suit paints a dire picture.<br><br>The scene is set in winter, the ground covered in snow. Icy flakes can be seen falling from above as two poor souls trudge through the snowy build-up. Their ragged clothing suggests that they are impoverished. Their lack of shoes depicts how dire their situation is.<br><br>Behind them is a colorful stained glass window. Etched into the pain are five golden pentacles. As beautiful as the window is, neither seems to notice.<br><br>The man to the left is on crutches. As he hobbles along in the snow, he raises his head to the sky. The positioning and his expression suggest he is searching for answers from God.<br><br>The figure to the right is probably a woman. However, it is hard to tell since most of his or her face is covered with a shawl and pointing to the ground in defeat.<br><br>Although they are walking together, it is obvious that the duo feels alone. The colors they wear are earth tones, suggesting that they are so involved in their physical problems, they can see nothing else.","Career and Finances":"The Five of Pentacles represents struggle and loss. Money, career, and material possessions are often the first to be affected during hard times. If you\'ve recently lost or job, your home, or had some other tragedy, this card can be representative of that.<br><br>There might be little you can do to prevent this stroke of bad luck, there is a way to handle these situations with grace. Although staying positive can be difficult, remembering that the situation is only temporary is key.<br><br>If you are struggling financially, do not be afraid to reach out for help. This is a lesson the paupers from the Five of Pentacles needed to learn as well.<br><br>After all, the lighting from the church window showed that help was nearby but the two were too immersed in their own self-pity to see the glow.<br><br>Are there resources nearby that you aren\'t noticing that can help free you from your current situation? It could be that a hopeless mindset is stopping you from recovery. Put on an armor of adaptability and keep pushing.","Love and Relationships":"The poor beggars depicted in the Five of Pentacles card are not alone, but they might as well be. Although they are traveling the same path, they are not walking side by side. These two seem worlds apart.<br><br>Divorce, break-ups, ending friendships, and rejection is usually viewed as a bad thing. However, staying in a situation that is toxic and stunts personal growth can be just as damaging.<br><br>If you feel alone or abandoned (physically or emotionally) or rejected by someone you care about, now is the time for you to strengthen your connection to your inner self.<br><br>Research ways to improve self-care. You will make it down this path and come out on the other side, but only if you make yourself a priority.","Health and Spirituality":"They say that \'stress kills\' and it is really true. If you are worrying yourself over things you cannot control, you are only weakening your immune system.<br><br>Your overall mental state will suffer as well. If you are feeling lost, drained, or emotionally spent\u2014stop where you are. To continue on the way that you are going will only deplete the energy you have left.<br><br>Instead, put yourself, your healing, and your spiritual desire front and center.

Instead of representing disappointment and loss, this flipped Minor Arcana signals that recovery is in full force. If you have been going through a hard time at work or at home, expect the tides to shift.<br><br>The same is true with your physical or emotional well-being. Now is a good time to try new things, say \'yes\' instead of \'no\', and focus on what you want and not what you lack.

Being charitable is seen by most as a part of good character. Consider Robin Hood. Because he gave to the poor, he was considered rich in spirit regardless of other character flaws.<br><br>It isn\'t just the down-and-out who benefit from charity though. Aristotle summarized it this way: \\"The unfortunate need people who will be kind to them; the prosperous need people to be kind to.\\"<br><br>The Six of Pentacles uses the influence of the tarot to spread this knowledge to all and encourage a giving spirit and helpful nature.<br><br>But is there such a thing as being too kind? This card also cautions about the danger of not setting boundaries and giving if it is to one\'s own detriment.There are two positions to take with this card: the position of the giver or the position of the receiver. Either way, the upright Six of Pentacles presents a positive outcome.<br><br>Are you in a very stable position in life? Do you have talents and resources that you are not using that could help others? If so, you might consider using what you have to help improve the situation of someone else or your community.<br><br>If you relate more to those seeking help (we all do in some way) and have been in great need of something, prepare yourself to receive what you desire.<br><br>The Six of Pentacles is very powerful in the present and future position as it speaks of giving and receiving much-needed blessings.","Visual Description":"The wealthy man from this Minor Arcana card is much different from the one depicted in the Four of Pentacles.<br><br>His purple garments and elaborate headwrap indicate that he is not only rich but quite possibly, royal.<br><br>In one hand he holds the coins that he is giving to the poor men kneeling at his feet. The evenly balanced scale that he holds with the other hand suggests he is interested in more than giving them a few coins.<br><br>As one of the beggars receives his pittance, the other looks up at the generous benefactor in awe.","Career and Finances":"When pulled in a money and career meaning, the Six of Pentacles is often connected to the following terms:<br><br>\u2727employment and hiring<br>\u2727donations<br>\u2727sponsorships<br>\u2727windfalls and inheritances<br>\u2727rewards<br>\u2727investors<br>\u2727new business opportunities<br>\u2727winnings<br><br>If you have been looking to start or fund a new business, the outlook is good. Help is at hand and whatever you need will soon come your way.<br><br>There is enough to go around, so worrying is not necessary. Instead, look for ways to position yourself to receive what you have been waiting for.<br><br>Those wanting to make a career change or receive a promotion/raise should be thrilled to see this card in their spread. By networking and connecting yourself to those who have the ability to give what you want, you will quickly climb the ladder.<br><br>On the flip side, if you are the one searching for meaningful ways to give back to humanity, now is the time to put a plan in motion.<br><br>The Six of Pentacles is representative of karmic energy. What you put out into the universe, good or bad, will return to you.","Love and Relationships":"As positive as this card is when it comes to money and career, the Six of Pentacles has an interesting message when it comes to relationships and love. In general, it suggests a relationship where all appears to be well.<br><br>However, past the surface, there is an imbalance in power. With one providing, giving, and controlling and the other partner sitting in a position of less control, things are less than equal.<br><br>For instance, it often presents itself when someone has married into money or in relationships where one partner is much more financially successful than the other. Although this isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, it can lead to resentment on both sides.<br><br>If one partner, friend, or family member is giving and giving and giving with little in return, the Six of Pentacles as a love card suggests the need to find balance.","Health and Spirituality":"If you are struggling with your physical or mental health, the Six of Pentacles tells you that help is one the way! You will soon partner with someone who will be able to assist you in getting things back on track.<br><br>The same can be said for those wanting to grow spiritually. A mentor of sorts will be able to assist in this process.<br><br>Perhaps it is you who wants to be of service? Sharing what you know or helping someone else grow is one of the best ways to give back to our world.","Reversed":"Most reversals have a meaning that is very opposite of what the upright card stands for. This is not really the case with the Six of Pentacles. Instead, the reversal urges you to look at the negatives connected to giving or receiving when there are no boundaries involved.<br><br>For example, it is good to give to our family and friends, always coming to rescue can breed dependence. You will want to make sure to consider every party\'s motives carefully.<br><br>Not everyone is truly seeking to give without expecting a steep return. The same can be said if you are in the giving position.<br><br>If the reversed Six of Pentacles has presented itself in your reading, be sure to read any business or investment contracts carefully. You\'ll also want to re-examine any one-sided relationships where you feel someone might be taking advantage of your generosity.<br><br>Also, be careful not to rack up debt in the name of doing something good. You are your very first priority and it is so important that you take care of your own needs before trying to give to others.","Combinations":"Sun, Empress, Ten of Wands or Five of Pentacles, Tower"},{"Suit":"Pentacles","Card":"Seven","Url Helper":"seven-of-pentacles","Url":"The Seven of Pentacles","Shorthand":"Upright: Planning, hard work, perseverance, rewards and result, long-term success<br>Reversed: Lack of planning, poor management, laziness, delay, impatience","General Meaning":"The Seven of Pentacles represents the not-so-distant days of our ancestors when everything was grown and made by hand.<br><br>Before large-scale farming and manufacturing existed, people toiled day in and day out.<br><br>They worked in difficult, and sometimes dangerous, conditions to provide for their families. For most, the goal was to make it to harvest season.<br><br>During harvest time, the crops could finally be gathered and sold. All of the planning and hard work manifested into fruits (and vegetables) of their labor. What once were small seeds in the ground became coins in their pockets.<br><br>Although few of us actually work in the agricultural business, the message of the Seven of Pentacles is still the same: long-term success is near if you are willing to put in the work.Because the Pentacles Suit is connected to the Earth Element, the Seventh card is a perfect representation.<br><br>It shows everything you have already accomplished when it comes to previous efforts.

This doesn\'t necessarily mean leaving the relationship, but it is time to assess your progress.<br><br>If you are in a long-term relationship, the things you\'ve been wanting are about to come to pass. This card comes up a lot before people get engaged.<br><br>If you\'re not entirely happy with your relationship, the Seven of Pentacles suggests it might be time to take things to the next level.<br><br>However, this should only happen after a period of reflection.

A little exercise, fewer carbs, and strengthened spiritual practices can go a long way.

When winter comes, the grasshopper begs his pals for food but the ants refuse.<br><br>Aesop\'s ants and the reversed Seven of Pentacles deliver the same message.
