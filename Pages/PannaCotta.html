                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>
                        The concept for 'Panna Cotta' took shape when I reevaluated my application package for instructional design work. Although confident in my skillset and suitability for the role, conveying my proficiency on paper proved challenging. One deficit I sought to rectify was my unfamiliarity with Articulate Storyline. I wanted to evidence my ability to master the software based on my experience with analogous tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        'Panna Cotta' emerged as a project born from the desire to explore the capabilities of Storyline, gain proficiency, and craft something technically impressive.

                    <h4>The Plan</h4>
                    <p>
                        Lately, I've found myself captivated by 'cozy' media, sparking a nostalgic yearning for lighthearted games like 'Cooking Mama.' For those unfamiliar, 'Cooking Mama' is an interactive cooking game where you get to stir, fry, mix, and serve food, all presented in a soft and endearing style. Despite its seemingly simple premise, this game offers a range of interactions, making it perfect for a technical showcase.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    <h4>The Goal</h4>
                    <p>
                        'How to Make Panna Cotta' is crafted as a quick, charming technical showcase. Although it's primarily designed as entertainment, users will also leave knowing the basics of creating this delicious and straightforward dessert. My hope is that the game not only brings joy but also inspires players to try making it in their own kitchens!

                <div>
                    <h4>Design Considerations</h4>
                    <p>
                        'Panna Cotta' was my first project in Articulate Storyline. I chose to work within an extremely tight deadline (5 days!) on this exploratory project to to leave the majority of the trial period available for my second, more involved project. You can learn more about that advanced project here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My aim was to feature a diverse array of complex interactions within an aesthetically pleasing design in order to demonstrate both my instructional and design prowess. In choosing the recipe for my cooking game, I knew it would need to have relatively few steps and ingredients. Thus, I decided on my husband's favorite anytime dessert: panna cotta.

                <div class="float-img-div">
                    <h4>Flowchart</h4>
                    <img class="img-shadow wrap-text-r" src="../Assets/Graphics/PageGraphics/PannaCotta/flowchart.jpg">
                    <p>
                        Once I determined the recipe I wanted to use, creating the flowchart of slides was a straightforward process. I systematically broke down the recipe into distinct steps and, by experimenting with the various types of input available, devised planned interactions for each individual step.

                    <p>
                        Given the tight timeline, illustrating every piece of art was not feasible. On a whim, I decided to explore Freepik's AI art generator and was pleasantly surprised by the results. AI-generated art often comes with peculiar artifacts, such as the original kitchen image lacking a faucet and the fridge appearing inside a window. Fortunately, my Photoshop skills came in handy, enabling me to edit the diverse pieces I gathered into a harmonious image set. The final artwork for this project is a fusion of hand-painted images from Freepik creators, AI-generated art edited by me, and my own illustrations. A comprehensive credit list is provided in the game.

                    <p>
                        With such complex interactions, it was necessary to build out and test the logic for the behind-the-scenes processing. It was much easier refine the trigger behaviors needed with simple shapes than to build out the whole visual design first. It was also at this step where I discarded a few interactions that would not work within the limitations of the software.

                        Users expressed delight with the charming graphics and immersive, user-friendly gameplay. Those who played earlier versions encountered issues that I promptly rectified. For instance, there was confusion about where to click to open the cabinet, so I enlarged the hitbox, ensuring it was more prominent and easier to interact with. Another issue arose for Safari users, where a particular asset failed to hide properly, which involved rewriting that object's triggers to correct the issue.

                    <h4>Future Improvements</h4>
                    <p>
                        With additional time for enhancements, one improvement I would implement is a more robust hint system. While the existing one serves its purpose, it lacks the responsiveness I would prefer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I developed this game for play on a computer. This choice was not deliberate; I simply didn't consider alternative devices during the design phase. As such, some of the interactions, namely hover actions, don't work intuitively on a touch-screen. If granted the time, I would revisit and conduct testing to optimize for mobile interaction.
